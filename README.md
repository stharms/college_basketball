some quick and dirty work to scrape and organize college basketball box scores and store them locally. part of another project I'm working that will likely never be finished

## For your use:
Use 'scrape_store.R' and source all of the files at the top of the script. It will pull all of the data for the time period you specify and write it to a local sqlite database (you can modify this however you please). It will take awhile (and don't do this too often! the sportsreference police will come for you). I have done some work to get the advanced stats without scraping by manually calculating them from the box scores. That work is in 'advancedstats.R'
